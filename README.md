## Development

### Folder Structure

This project follows a modular structure to maintain scalability and organization:

- **`src/assets/`**: Stores images, logos, fonts, and other static resources.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI components (e.g., `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Testimonies`, etc.).
- **`src/data/`**: Houses JSON files for dynamic data such as blogs, testimonials, practice areas, and contact information.
- **`src/pages/`**: Each major section of the site (e.g., `Home`, `About`, `PracticeAreas`, `Contact`) has its own folder.
- **`src/styles/`**: TailwindCSS configurations and additional CSS modules for custom styling.
- **`src/utils/`**: Utility functions and hooks that can be reused across components.
- **`src/App.js`**: Main application component where routing is configured.
- **`src/index.js`**: Entry point for the React application.

### Adding New Content

- **Updating Data**: To update blogs, clients, practice areas, or testimonials, simply edit the corresponding JSON files in `src/data/`.
- **Adding New Components**: Create new components in `src/components/` and import them into the relevant pages or `App.js` for routing.

---

## Styling & Configuration

- **TailwindCSS**: The project uses TailwindCSS for utility-first, responsive design. Custom styles such as fonts, colors, and spacing are configured in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- **Background Images & Animations**: Subtle background images are used in key sections like "Practice Areas" and "Testimonials" with added parallax effects. Hover animations and transitions ensure a polished user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: Media queries and Tailwind's responsive utilities are used to adjust layouts and fonts for different screen sizes, ensuring mobile-first usability.

---

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** for testing React components. You can run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the unit tests and display the results for each component. Ensure that all tests pass before pushing any changes.
